'''Potential Flow'', also know as '''Incompressible Flow''' or '''Irrotational Flow''' in [[Fluid mechanics]] is flow defined by the equations

 &grad; &cross; '''v''' = 0    (zero rotation = no shear)

 &grad; &dot; '''v''' = 0      (zero divergence = continuity)

Equivalently,

  '''v''' = &grad; &Phi;

  v vector fluid velocity
  &Phi; fluid flow potential, scalar

Together with the [[Navier-Stokes equations]], these equations can be used to calculate solutions to many practical flow situations.
